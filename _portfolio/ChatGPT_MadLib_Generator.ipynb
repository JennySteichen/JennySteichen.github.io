    "# Creating Mad Libs with ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "[Mad Libs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs) is a party game for lightening up family holidays, baby showers, and more.  Each game consists of a short story with many key words replace by blanks.  To play the game, one person, the “writer”, goes through each blank in the story and and asks the rest of the players to give a noun, verb, place, etc that is indicated by the blank.  When all the blanks are filled, the completed story is read aloud.  The resulting story is usually silly, comical, or surreal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[OpenAI’s ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) has been in the news – teachers are afraid that students will use it to write their essays, it can pass exams, and people use it to write their resumes.  \n",
    "\n",
