I am a Data Scientist/Career Changer.  For the last few years, I've been learning Data Science and 
Machine Learning from Coursera.  Before this, I took a long break from technical
work for family care and homeschooling my children.  During that break, I designed K-12 classes,
especially in math, statistics, and problem solving.  My first data science project
was quarterly checklists for my students.

Before my break, I did a postdoc at IBM research, earned my PhD in math, worked as an
engineer, and worked at various other technical jobs.
