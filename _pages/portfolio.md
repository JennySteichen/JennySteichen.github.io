Titanic Kaggle Competition
-----

<img height="150" src="/images/titanic_feature_elimination.png">

[Ranked in the top 7%](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/leaderboard) of the Kaggle Competition for prediction which passengers survived the Titanic.  My submission included data imputation for missing data, creating new features, comparing different models, and creating ensemble models.  An [outline of my submission](https://github.com/JennySteichen/JennySteichen.github.io/blob/master/_portfolio/TitanicPredictionNotebook.ipynb) gives an idea of my thinking process.

Prompt Engineering Example -- ChatGPT and Mad Libs
------

Demonstrated the difference a prompt can make with ChatGPT.  Used the example of generating [Mad Libs with different prompts](https://github.com/JennySteichen/JennySteichen.github.io/blob/master/_portfolio/ChatGPT_MadLib_Generator.ipynb).

NLP Word Embeddings
------

In Natural Language Processing (NLP),  [Word Embeddings](https://github.com/JennySteichen/JennySteichen.github.io/blob/master/_portfolio/WordEmbeddings.ipynb) represent words with real-valued vectors in sucha way that word embedding vectors that are close correspond to words that are similar in meaning. In this project, we use Linear Algebra to 
- Solve Word Analogies
- Discover bias in the word embeddings
- Neutralize bias in words like "receptionist"
- Apply equalization to pairs of words like "actor" and "actress" on either side of a bias to make them reflections over the bias vector.

Student Dashboard

My homeschooling students used [student dashboards](https://github.com/JennySteichen/JennySteichen.github.io/blob/master/_portfolio/Student%20Dashboard.xlsx) to measure their quarterly progress.
