[Ranked in the top 7%](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/leaderboard) of the Kaggle Competition for prediction which passengers survived the Titanic.  My submission included data imputation for missing data, creating new features, comparing different models, and creating ensemble models.  An [outline of my submission](https://github.com/JennySteichen/JennySteichen.github.io/blob/master/_portfolio/TitanicPredictionNotebook.ipynb) gives an idea of my thinking process.
